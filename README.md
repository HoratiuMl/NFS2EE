# Need for Speed 2 Remastered Edition

This is a project based on [NFSIISE](https://github.com/zaps166/NFSIISE) that aims to provide additional functionality on top of what the original game has to offer.

# Goals

- New languages
- Completely replace all of the original assets with HD open-source ones
- Additional content (tracks, cars, etc...)

# Contributions

Anyone is free to contribute to this project.

You can find information about the file formats, conventions, and how to edit different aspects of the game, on the [NFS2Tools Wiki pages](https://github.com/HoratiuMl/nfs2tools/wiki) of this project.
